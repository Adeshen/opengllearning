# MOTIVATION
there is requisition of my intern firm to need use openGl
so I start the project.

# opengldemo1

I learn how to config glew and glfw in visual stdio

there are 3 points:
1. In the project setting, add include path which store the .h file

2. In the project setting, add linker lib storage path, and add the lib name too
    opengl32.lib  glew32s.lib  glfw.lib

3. keep the match between lib and dll
